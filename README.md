Each folder comes with instructions in a README file.

If you would like to know more about ES6, you'll find an article for each feature in the series
[ES6 In Depth Articles](https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/es6-in-depth/) published by Mozilla Hacks.

## Branches

 * [es6-in-depth](https://github.com/givanse/broccoli-babel-examples/tree/es6-in-depth) - The original code as it was released when the Mozilla article was published. These are the code samples for [ES6 In Depth: Using ES6 today with Babel and Broccoli](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-babel-and-broccoli/).
 * [master](https://github.com/givanse/broccoli-babel-examples/tree/master) - The most up to date code. It mainly consists of dependencies upgrades.

## Examples

### 1. [es6-fruits](https://github.com/givanse/broccoli-babel-examples/tree/master/es6-fruits)

A minimal example that shows you how to transpile a single ES6 script and then execute it through the command line.

### 2. [es6-website](https://github.com/givanse/broccoli-babel-examples/tree/master/es6-website)

Transpile all the ES6 files found in target location and concatenate them into a single ES5 file that is imported into a simple website.

### 3. [es6-modules](https://github.com/givanse/broccoli-babel-examples/tree/master/es6-modules)

A usage example of [jayphelps/broccoli-babel-boilerplate](https://github.com/jayphelps/broccoli-babel-boilerplate), its a more sophisticated setup that handles:

* modules
* imports
* unit tests

Its meant to be the starting point for ambitious projects.
